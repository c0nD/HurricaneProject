## Overview

This project is dedicated to predicting and classifying hurricane trajectories and intensities using advanced machine learning techniques. Utilizing a rich dataset from NOAA's Hurricanes and Typhoons records, we apply models from scikit-learn and Keras to forecast various aspects of hurricanes. Additionally, we classify hurricanes into categories to understand their potential impact. This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that document the data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## Getting Started

To work with this project, you should have Python installed on your machine. We use Poetry for dependency management to maintain a consistent development environment.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Poetry for dependency management

If you haven't installed Poetry yet, please follow the instructions on the [official Poetry website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies using Poetry:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/c0nD/HurricaneProject
cd HurricaneProject

# Install dependencies with Poetry
poetry install
```
This will set up a virtual environment and install all the necessary dependencies as specified in the pyproject.toml file.  

## Notebooks
The analysis and modeling are segmented into Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on a particular stage of the project. To replicate our process or dive deeper into the analysis, refer to the `reference` folder, which contains tutorials and additional documentation.
